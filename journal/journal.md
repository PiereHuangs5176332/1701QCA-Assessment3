### Related project 1 ###
*Forever 21 Thread Screen*

This project is related to mine because they have used some kind of "motor" to keep the colors changing and spinning, where in my project, I have also used a motor, and in one of my very first attempt of my project I though of the same conecpt where i have a big scroll that changes color as well.

### Related project 2 ###
*Shack motor toy*

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, where they use the motor to shake the bottle which while the bottle is shaking the bottle moves from its initial position, we kind of share to same concept on motors and this is also one of the project people can play for a long time and spend time watching it while doing nothing which is what I am looking for for my project.

### Related project 3 ###
*Kinetic Wall: Arduino Spiral Wall*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiGKk-7Hwhg*

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, in this project, they use the motor connected with lines to make amazing art, and the visual is really great while the lines tangle into each other and changes shape. As the lines rotate into one direction it shrinks and in other direction is expands which creats amazing visual interaction with the audiences. 

### Related project 4 ###
*Kinetic Origami with Arduino Servo Sketch*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXsCaOo4FBI*

This project is related to mine because they use a thing called "Arduino Servo Sketch" where it kind of works like an motor, and in this project it was connected with a line where the line is connected to the origami, and as the motor spins, the origami expands and shrinks which creats an amazing visual effect for viewers. 


### Related project 5 ###
*Carousel*

*https://www.lemaxcollection.com/villages/caddington/sights-and-sounds/the-grand-carousel-84349*

![Image](128.png)

An carousel is related to my project is becasue it is controlled by an giant motor for it to spin, and in my final version of my project after many different attempts, I have came up with something similar to an carousel. Where in my project the motor controls my platform to spin, I believe that my project shares the same concept with the carousel.

### Related project 6 ###
*Baby-Burping Robot*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zb5gKw6q3o*

![Image](129.png)

This project is related to mine because what they have created is fun, not useful and really entertaining, where it is what I really am aiming for in my project, but also I think that they have used an motor for the robot to spin in a high speed, after all this project is like my final design fantasy where it has all the elements I am looking for in an project.

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. ---> 
*I have also gone through experiment 4 from the inventor's kit to get a better understanding of how the motor works, the coding and how to connect it with the microbits.
Searching up different kind of hyponic siwrl online to have a knoweledge of different kinds of swirl and which would work best actually "spinning" and coming up with an final outcome to put into the project.
Done some researches on "motor" related project that could help my project in process, and most of them are the "related projects" shown on top*

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. ---> *An machine/device that has no other use than just entertainment really*

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. ---> ### Design concept 1 ###
A car kind of toy that will move away from users once it is turned on. So the idea of this concept is to create a car toy that will keep moving away from the user once it is turned on, and you will never know which way it will be going the next second, therefore the toy car will be incredibly hard to catch.

![Image](2.png)

After some attempt: After a few attempts on trying to complete this concept, I have failed in creating an motor based toy car, and also that the motor was not able to create enough power to carry the whole breadboard and microbit for an paper made car to move, therefore this concept ended in a failure.

### Design concept 2 ###
An on/off switch that switches it self off like the "useless box" or shares the same concept, just a thing that keeps the users entertained.

![Image](WechatIMG278.jpeg)

After some attempt: After a few attempts with this concept, I have failed with creating an on/off switch for the project, and the line puller didnt work out as i expected where I tried to use the motor as an line puller but there was no switch for the motor to pull, and the other issue i have came accross was that the motor only spins in one direction, for it to change direction i would have to switch the lines connecting the motor around, in result of that this concept ended inan failure.

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
