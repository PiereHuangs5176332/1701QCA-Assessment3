### Related project 1 ###
*Forever 21 Thread Screen*

This project is related to mine because they have used some kind of "motor" to keep the colors changing and spinning, where in my project, I have also used a motor, and in one of my very first attempt of my project I though of the same conecpt where i have a big scroll that changes color as well.

### Related project 2 ###
*Shack motor toy*

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, where they use the motor to shake the bottle which while the bottle is shaking the bottle moves from its initial position, we kind of share to same concept on motors and this is also one of the project people can play for a long time and spend time watching it while doing nothing which is what I am looking for for my project.

### Related project 3 ###
*Kinetic Wall: Arduino Spiral Wall*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiGKk-7Hwhg*

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, in this project, they use the motor connected with lines to make amazing art, and the visual is really great while the lines tangle into each other and changes shape. As the lines rotate into one direction it shrinks and in other direction is expands which creats amazing visual interaction with the audiences. 

### Related project 4 ###
*Kinetic Origami with Arduino Servo Sketch*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXsCaOo4FBI*

![Image](127.png)

This project is related to mine because they use a thing called "Arduino Servo Sketch" where it kind of works like an motor, and in this project it was connected with a line where the line is connected to the origami, and as the motor spins, the origami expands and shrinks which creats an amazing visual effect for viewers. 


### Related project 5 ###
*Carousel*

*https://www.lemaxcollection.com/villages/caddington/sights-and-sounds/the-grand-carousel-84349*

![Image](128.png)

An carousel is related to my project is becasue it is controlled by an giant motor for it to spin, and in my final version of my project after many different attempts, I have came up with something similar to an carousel. Where in my project the motor controls my platform to spin, I believe that my project shares the same concept with the carousel.

### Related project 6 ###
*Baby-Burping Robot*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zb5gKw6q3o*

![Image](129.png)

This project is related to mine because what they have created is fun, not useful and really entertaining, where it is what I really am aiming for in my project, but also I think that they have used an motor for the robot to spin in a high speed, after all this project is like my final design fantasy where it has all the elements I am looking for in an project.



### *Insert name of related project here* ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](missingimage.png)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Name of related project](https://[URL of related project])

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->

<!--- Repeat code above for a total of 6 related projects --->

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
