This project is related to mine because they have used some kind of "motor" to keep the colors changing and spinning, where in my project, I have also used a motor, and in one of my very first attempt of my project I though of the same conecpt where i have a big scroll that changes color as well.

### Related project 2 ###

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, where they use the motor to shake the bottle which while the bottle is shaking the bottle moves from its initial position, we kind of share to same concept on motors and this is also one of the project people can play for a long time and spend time watching it while doing nothing which is what I am looking for for my project.

### Related project 3 ###
*Kinetic Wall: Arduino Spiral Wall*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiGKk-7Hwhg*

![Image](126.png)

This project is related to mine because they have also used motor in their project, in this project, they use the motor connected with lines to make amazing art, and the visual is really great while the lines tangle into each other and changes shape. As the lines rotate into one direction it shrinks and in other direction is expands which creats amazing visual interaction with the audiences. 

### Related project 4 ###
*Kinetic Origami with Arduino Servo Sketch*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXsCaOo4FBI*

![Image](127.png)

This project is related to mine because they use a thing called "Arduino Servo Sketch" where it kind of works like an motor, and in this project it was connected with a line where the line is connected to the origami, and as the motor spins, the origami expands and shrinks which creats an amazing visual effect for viewers. 


### Related project 5 ###
*Carousel*

*https://www.lemaxcollection.com/villages/caddington/sights-and-sounds/the-grand-carousel-84349*

![Image](128.png)

An carousel is related to my project is becasue it is controlled by an giant motor for it to spin, and in my final version of my project after many different attempts, I have came up with something similar to an carousel. Where in my project the motor controls my platform to spin, I believe that my project shares the same concept with the carousel.

### Related project 6 ###
*Baby-Burping Robot*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zb5gKw6q3o*

![Image](129.png)

This project is related to mine because what they have created is fun, not useful and really entertaining, where it is what I really am aiming for in my project, but also I think that they have used an motor for the robot to spin in a high speed, after all this project is like my final design fantasy where it has all the elements I am looking for in an project.

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. ---> 
*I have also gone through experiment 4 from the inventor's kit to get a better understanding of how the motor works, the coding and how to connect it with the microbits.
Searching up different kind of hyponic siwrl online to have a knoweledge of different kinds of swirl and which would work best actually "spinning" and coming up with an final outcome to put into the project.
Done some researches on "motor" related project that could help my project in process, and most of them are the "related projects" shown on top*

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. ---> *An machine/device that has no other use than just entertainment really*

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. ---> ### Design concept 1 ###
A car kind of toy that will move away from users once it is turned on. So the idea of this concept is to create a car toy that will keep moving away from the user once it is turned on, and you will never know which way it will be going the next second, therefore the toy car will be incredibly hard to catch.

![Image](2.png)

After some attempt: After a few attempts on trying to complete this concept, I have failed in creating an motor based toy car, and also that the motor was not able to create enough power to carry the whole breadboard and microbit for an paper made car to move, therefore this concept ended in a failure.

### Design concept 2 ###
An on/off switch that switches it self off like the "useless box" or shares the same concept, just a thing that keeps the users entertained.

![Image](WechatIMG278.jpeg)

After some attempt: After a few attempts with this concept, I have failed with creating an on/off switch for the project, and the line puller didnt work out as i expected where I tried to use the motor as an line puller but there was no switch for the motor to pull, and the other issue i have came accross was that the motor only spins in one direction, for it to change direction i would have to switch the lines connecting the motor around, in result of that this concept ended inan failure.

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. ---> A machine/device that you can just play with and have fun with it like the "useless box", an machine/device that has no other use than just entertainment really.

What problem do you want to solve?

With everything moving on the online now, we stay indoors a lot longer, and I in person feel bored most of the time, and hard to find something to do, being bored is an issue as time tends do feel going slower and longer, specially with the virus going on around the world, it is important for us to stay indoors which makes it more important to solve the "bored" issue so people stay indoors more.

What experience I want the users to experience?

An entertaining time while the users interact with the project and while interacting with the project they lose the track of time. With most of the people staying home now, I see the users using this project to kill their time for time to go faster and to be entertained.

My final concept was actually: an slide of different colors that just keep sliding in a circle, where you can look at it for ages and do nothing. But unfortunally this concept also ended as a failure, as trying to use the same concept with the related project 1 "forever 21" I have used toilet rolles (as they are the lightest and most stable material i can find) to create a scroll for color papers to spin on, but after connecting with the motor, the motor couldn't create enough force to spin the scroll, and after changing the materialls to think sticks (wood) it was still to heavy for the motor to spin, in my final attempt i have tried using paper to scroll them into a scroll, but the results were the same, and my concept ended in a failure so I had to came up with something different. 

Due to the failure in the making process in Assessment 2, I have/had to changed my final concept into a spinning platform, but even after changing the concept, I still came across alot of problems but I end up solving them, and they will be documented in the "process documentation" section below to show the process.

What I came up with in the end was an spinning platform made from condensed foam witch is really light, and the motor was able to give it a good spin. This final prototype actually came from another failure concept that I have tried when everything was failing, and that was the display platform, it shares the same concept as the spinning platform, but with the display platform I need it to place something onto the platform for it to "display" but when I try to display something on to it, the condensed foam breaks as it it too light to be haveing pressure on it, there for I have to come up with another idea/concept again.

The related projects really helped me to go throguh the problem solving stage speciall when everything was failuring and having to come up with a different idea, having to look at different projects really helps.


### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. ---> 

![Image](flow.jpeg)

What I do not want and expect the user to do is to put their hands into or onto the spinning platform, as users could breake the whole project or hurt themselves by the high speed spinning platform, as the intention of this was for users to look at, and the aim of the project was for users to lose trac of time while looking at it.

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->
Since I have failed many times with my concept, I will be sharing the failure concepts process with the only concept that was a success compare to the other concepts. Starting with the coding experiemtns with the motor, i ahve tried different motor power/spin power, and I have found out that higher the number is the more power the motore provides and that goes for the opposite as well, but after all the motor couldn't provide enough power for my other concepts.

Within all the coding experiments, I have also tried to make the motor spin in the opposite direction by using code, but it resulted in a failure.

![Image](001.jpeg)
Starting off everything with the experiment 4 in the inventor's kit to trial with the motor.
![Image](002.jpeg)
![Image](003.jpeg)
Attemp of trying to connect the tolite rolles with the motor which ened in success at the start with only 1 section connected as it wasn't weighting much at the start, but when the whole scroll was completed, it was to heavy for the motor to handle, in result i wasn't spinning. 
![Image](004.jpeg)
![Image](005.jpeg)
![Image](006.jpeg)
![Image](007.jpeg)
![Image](008.jpeg)
![Image](009.jpeg)
At the start when the motor wasn't spinning, I though that it was becasue the motor had no support on it's base, so I created a base for the motor using a shoe box which it was holding the motor tight and proving some mass holding the motor. 
![Image](010.jpeg)
![Image](011.jpeg)
After the failure with the tolite scroll, I have switched it to thin wood sticks.
![Image](012.jpeg)
![Image](013.jpeg)
Using the paper and scrolling them into a pole like center, I then connected to the think wood sticks, but it was too heavy for the motor, as I pull of the pole like paper, the motor started spinning again, in result I have to give up on this idea.
![Image](014.jpeg)
![Image](015.jpeg)
With everything failing, I then though of maybe I can create something like an item displayer, so I  have created an spinning platform with condensed foam which was finally light enough for the motor to spin it, but for this item displayer, I needed the motor to spin the platform with a line connecting the platform and the motor within the gap in the platform, but the line had no friction for the motor to spin it, so I changed the line into rubber bands, but when switching to rubber bands, the motor again don't have enough force to spin the rubberband as it creates too much friction, so I had to think of an different idea again. 
![Image](016.jpeg)
![Image](017.jpeg)
As for the final, I got something to work, and it wasn't too bad, I had to stick the tip of the papers together so when it spins it doesn't expand and hit the microbits, and when it is sticked together, upon when it's spinning it kind of looks like an flower which is pretty cool. 

After some feedback from the teachers, I have created some more spinning platforms with different patterns made with condensed foam. In an 1 on 1 conversation with my teacher on what I can do to make my project alot better, we talked about hypnotic swirl, and then I though how come I have never though of that before?? And after some research on the swirl, finding what presents best when "actually" spinning, I have came up with some final design, and recorded it functioning.

Covering up the Microbit breadboard and motor in a simple and clean way, what i can think of the an plain sheet of paper, and the result of it looks pretty clean. Before useing sheets of paper to cover the microvit up, I did consider to cover up the microbit with condensed foam, but condensed was not as flexable as sheets of paper and can't really provide and show the "simple" vide I Wwanted for the exterior of the cover, therfore I have used sheets of paper to cover the microbit up, and the results was great.

This is what it looks like with an platform on of the project.

For the end, I want to explain how the device will be turned on, the project would have a long cord which is like a charger line, and between the cord will have an on and off switch like and desk light, where after the user place their own designed platform onto the motor, they would switch it on for the motor to spin and off for the motor to stop, the whole project will be connected to the cord where the cord will be connect to the power point, as the users can turn the project freely on and off as they wanted. 

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->
![Image](0.png)
This is the final coding, as it looks simple but is all the project needed, after having more look, research and experiment, I have removed the "forever" block as it was not needed, and left with this final code.

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->
![Image](dimond.jpeg)
The process of this whole project was kind of a disaster, as my concepts keeps failing, half way of making this project I was feeling really down on how everything was not working and I couldn't find a solution to solve the problems I have encounter, but I guess never giving up brings some good news that the end that finally I got something working, and all that is left is too make it more good looking and better functional as it is only a prototype. Finally with something working now, all I need to focus now is how can I make this a better project. There were definitly something that I could have done different that could change the result of many things, more consultation with my tutors would have helped alot while everything wasn't working for me, will defninitly keep that in mind and will engage with the tutors more in the future.

After getting some feedback from the teacher and further research done for the project after Assessment2, the project has finally came to its final stage, I would like to talk about the big difference of the project I had in Assessment 2 and Assessment 3, so in the previous assessment, the project I created dont really have much "interaction" with the user as the user would just "look at it", but in my final project, I would say there is more "interaction" with the user, as I created different pattern platforms and a idea came throuhg me as the users can create different pattern platforms that they would like, and an on/off switch which is added as a desk light cord, with these new elements added into the project, yhe project is now in its' final stage. 

The project now have reached my expectations on "time killing" where during the making process and testing process, I in person actually looked at the spinning platform spin for about a whole 7 minutes, as 7 minutes might not sound long, but if i was to sit or stand and do nothing for a whole 7 minutes, I would not feel great and fun, and as more platform pattern could be added, more time could be killed etc. After all I am happy with the outcome of the project after all the research, work, trial & error and experiment done. 

## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->

Having a look at different projects that related to mine gave me an idea of how far my project could go, and having an idea of how can I accomplish my goals in my projects, as the related projects are all final outcomes, it is great to have them as a reference, as when I needed some solutions I could find them in the related projects. 

What I feel novel about my project is that the ability of my project to interactive with people in a simple way, as everything is moving digital now, how long has it been for the new generation or even the older genertion to actually "make" something? We are on our phones everyday, but we still find it boring sometimes why? This is a questions many people will find it hard to answer even including me, but after I started to make this project, I came to a conclusion, is that people are no longer apart of an "making process" as we can just jump to solutions by searching online and downloading them, we are no longer being creative, but in my project, the users will be required to make their own pattern for the platform and putting the platform onto the motor, it is a simple process, by we are finally "apart" of an process, and when I think of what pattern I want to put onto my platform, "Time really Flies", as I can't wait to see what it looks like spinning and what other patterns I can create to see something interesting. 

After the pattern is created, I couldn't mover my eyes away from the platform as it creates such an interesting view, and this has reached my expectations that I had initially in my concepts, and I am happy with the outcome with the project.

An interesting extension of this project could be one of the idea me and my class mate have talked about, in relation to Rebecca Harrison's project, her project is an puzzle box, I though that maybe it was possible to combine the two concepts and create a different kind of puzzle solving game, where the platform would be like an dart board with numbers on it, and as the platform spins the users will need to hit the correct number the solve the puzzle, and with the harder levels the platforms could spin faster creating challenge for the users and maybe as it spins the numbers could swap places...etc. This is an very interesting extension of my project with relation to other people's project, and defnintly a cool ideal to be looking at in the future.
